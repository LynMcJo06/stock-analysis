# Stock Analysis
## Introduction
In this module, our client Steve is a recent graduate with a Finance degree.  Steve's parents are interested in green energy and want to start investing.  One company caught their attention:  DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ).  Steve's parents want to invest only in this stock, which has Steve concerned.  Steve has asked for our help to determine if DQ is a good investment.  
### Lesson 1
We are going to start by analyzing a variety of clean energy stocks just in case DAQO turns out negatively.  We converted our Excel spreadsheet to a macro-enabled sheet and learned several new terms.  To ensure that VBA was working properly, we created a simply macro that printed "Hello World!"  Woohoo!  I have created my first piece of code.  
### Lesson 2
In this lesson, we started analyzing the stock data.  We first added a new worksheet titled "DQ Analysis", to display our output analysis.  our macro started simple and gradually grew as our knowledge of the VBA coding language grew.  Steve's parents are convinced that a stock is a good investment if it is traded frequently, so we determined the total daily volume of DQ stock for 2018.   In 2018, DQ's Total Daily Volume was 107,873,900.  We also calculated DQ's 2018 yearly return.  This portion required a nested for loop incorporating logical operators and conditional statements.  We researched how to create a portion of our code via the Internet.  The results are documented in the code block.  After running our DQ Analysis code block, DQ's early return was -0.626, which equates to a loss of approximately 63%.  We are concerned about Steve's parents investing in DQ.  
### Lesson 3
For this lesson, we analyzed all stocks to get their total daily volume and 2018 yearly return.  We were able to reuse a lot of our code from the previous lesson by making minor changes.  After we ran this code block, only two of the eleven stocks had a positive yearly return:  ENPH and RUN, 82% and 84%, respectively.  
### Lesson 4
In this lesson, we formatted the All Stocks Analysis sheet to make it readable.  We created a new macro and added our own formatting as well as the coursework.  
### Lesson 5
In Lesson 5, we learned how to make the worksheets interactive.  We first created buttons in the All Stocks Analysis and DQ Analysis sheets.  The buttons cleared the sheet and ran the analysis.  We then created an Input Box so the analysis could be performed on stocks for any year.  I tried it using both 2017 and 2018 and it worked wonderfully.
