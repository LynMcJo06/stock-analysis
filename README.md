Module 2 VBA exercises
In this module, our client is Steve a recent graduate with a Finance degree.  Steve's parents are interested in green energy and want to start investing.  One company caught their attention:  DAQO New Energy Corp.  The parents want to invest all their allocated money to this stock.  Steve needs our help to make sure that it's a good investment.  
We are going to start my analyzing a variety of clean energy stocks just in case DAQO turns out negatively.  
We converted our Excel spreadsheet to a macro-enabled sheet.  
We created a simple macro to make sure VBA was working properly.  The macro was "Hello World!"  
We created a new worksheet titled "DQ Analysis" because the ticker symbol for DAQO is DQ.  We developed a macro to populate the new sheet.  
We developed a macro to sum the amount of DQ stock traded in year 2018.  Steve's parents are convinced that a stock is a good investment if it is traded frequently.   
Next we needed to create a macro to give us the yearly return of the stock for 2018.  We were not sure how to create a portion of the macro and conducted online research.  We added this code to our macro and sited the source of the code.  
We ran the macro and the yearly was -0.626, which equates to a loss of approximately 63%.
