# Stock Analysis
## Introduction
In this module, our client Steve is a recent graduate with a Finance degree.  Steve's parents are interested in green energy and want to start investing.  One company caught their attention:  DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ).  Steve's parents want to invest only in this stock, which has Steve concerned.  Steve has asked for our help to determine if DQ is a good investment.  
### Lesson 1
We are going to start by analyzing a variety of clean energy stocks just in case DAQO turns out negatively.  We converted our Excel spreadsheet to a macro-enabled sheet.  To ensure that VBA was working properly, we created a simply macro that printed "Hello World!"  Woohoo!  I have created my first piece of code.  

We created a new worksheet titled "DQ Analysis" because the ticker symbol for DAQO is DQ.  We developed a macro to populate the new sheet.  
We developed a macro to sum the amount of DQ stock traded in year 2018.  Steve's parents are convinced that a stock is a good investment if it is traded frequently.   
Next we needed to create a macro to give us the yearly return of the stock for 2018.  We were not sure how to create a portion of the macro and conducted online research.  We added this code to our macro and sited the source of the code.  
We ran the macro and the yearly was -0.626, which equates to a loss of approximately 63%.
